		<p class ="capabilities1">You may have noticed through our website, we are people who work on ourselves first to change the world. We are inspired by an old man who is a freemason. He gave us our abilities and now we want to make them known to the Testos</p>
	    <p class ="capabilities2"> <br> One problem that the <br> individual members of the team  <br> often had themselves was when it came <br> to  sniping. Let's face it, if you don't have a <br> snipebot or WL place you have really no chance of being part of a great project. We were actually against making a snipebot out of the Testos from the beginning, but we decided to do so for the following reasons. On the one hand, we don't want to be behind the times, we want to be part of the future and the snipebot is part of that. We want to solve <br> problems of our community problems of <br> our community and not to stick <br> stubbornly to old things. </p>
	    <p class ="capabilities3"> <br> Another ability of the Testos <br> will be that with them you will get <br> access to a NFT teaching course, which <br> will probably be in groups of 10.  A large part <br> of the team lives by a very beautiful quote. <br> "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for life." We don't want to teach you how to fish, of course but to <br> show you methods and ways of thinking about how to succeed in NFT trading. This also includes that we will set up a closed Discord Server where new promising NFT-Collections will be shown all the time and according to our research this is not a kind of promotion. But we have to that <br> nothing is based on a 100% chance of <br> winning, you should never trust <br> blindly and do your own <br>research. </p>
	    <p class ="capabilities4"> <br> Probably the most <br> obvious point, which can be easily guessed, is that you can also stak our testos. We should probably note that this will still take a while as a while, as we will not be focusing on this, but first on the aforementioned <br> abilities. </p>
	    <p class ="capabilities5"> <br> The last thing that the <br> Testo team came up with was to <br> build up some kind of story. We have <br> some very creative minds in our team who came up with these came up with these ideas and will certainly tell entertaining stories. The plan is to publish the first blog after 1-2 weeks, which will be public. After that, there will be either a sequel or a new part twice a week. Please note that we will post the first blog publicly on our website, for each following story you will need a testo. You will need a testo. The blogs <br> will only be available for you to <br> see as long as you have a <br> Testo. </p>
	    <p class ="capabilities6"> <br> Finally we would like <br> to say that we donate about 30% of the proceeds from the sale to an organization. We want to set a good example and donate the 30% to wilderness International. It is an organization that takes care of the rainforest. <br> </p>
